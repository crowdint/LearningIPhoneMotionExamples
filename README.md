# Learning iPhone Programming Ruby Motion examples

We recently had a need to develop a iOS application, so decided to train
ourselves to do it.

We picked the [Learning iPhone Programming](http://learningiphoneprogramming.com/)
book by Alasdair Allan as our starting point, and been happy about it so far.

For bonus points, another thing that we wanted to learn, was iOS development
with [Ruby Motion](www.rubymotion.com).

This repo will hold all the examples in Alasdair's book, but ported to work
with Ruby Motion.

Even though Ruby motion makes it very familiar for Ruby developers to write
iOS apps, you still need to learn how the Cocoa libraries work, and its patterns.

I recommend this path. Buy Alasdair's book, go through the examples, build them
with X-Code and Objective-C first, then, try to build them with Ruby motion.

This repo holds those examples already coded for guidance, but, I recommend you
build your own.

Happy iOS coding

Feel free to send Pull Requests with improvements to the code. As I mentioned,
we're just learning and there might be ways to optimize what we're doing.
